## Welcome
Each course day will have its own md file. Just like this one. If you missed something during the class have a look at the dedicated Readme. 
Today we will try to setup your Git environment, which you need to make and save changes in your code. We do also need to create a new ssh key. You can see this as a form of authentication for your Github Repository, this is were your code will be stored. You can find more general information in the README.md. 

## Github Account
Did everyone create a Github account? If not we can do this now together. 

### Github Student 
You can register for the Github student developer pack. Doing so you get Github Copilot, AI coding assistent, as well as a free domain and a bunch of other stuff

## Git Install
First let's check if you already have git installed:
- Open terminal on macOS or Git Bash on Windows
- Type `git --version`
- If you receive a version number, git is already installed

In case git is not installed:
- Download git for Windows or macOS: https://git-scm.com/
- Install with admin privileges
- You can verify the installation by opening terminal on macOS or Git Bash on Windows
- Type `git --version`
- If you receive a version number, git has been installed successfully

## VSCode
Visual Studio Code is our primary code editor. The following guide explains how to install and set up VSCode on Windows, macOS, and Linux:
[VSCode Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

We will also use the **Live Server** extension, which allows us to run HTML files locally in the browser with automatic reload on changes. Install it here:

After installing, you can access it from the bottom status bar in VSCode.

## SSH Key
An SSH key is a secure way to authenticate with GitHub without entering your password every time. Follow this guide to generate and add an SSH key to your account:
[SSH Key Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 

## Fork the Course Repository
- Open the [course repo](https://github.com/maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaax/www-design)
- Click the fork button in the top right corner
- You will now have your own copy of the course repository

## Clone Your Repository to Your Local Computer
- To work on your own project, you need to clone your version of the repository to your computer
- Make sure you've set up your SSH key correctly before proceeding
- Navigate to your fork of the repository on GitHub (you can find it under your Profile → Repositories)
- Click the green "Code" button and select "SSH"
- Copy the text that appears (it looks like `git@github.com:yourname/www-design.git`)
- On macOS: Open Terminal and navigate to where you want to save the repository
- On Windows: Open Git Bash and navigate to where you want to save the repository
- Type: `git clone` followed by the text you copied
- You can now open the folder in VSCode and start working with the code

## Git Workflow
Now that you have your repository cloned locally, here's how to save and share your changes:
> You can do all of this inside VSCode using the UI. Don't stress about using the terminal

### `git add`
Stage your changes for commit. This tells Git which files you want to include in your next save point.
- Type `git add filename` to stage a specific file
- Type `git add .` to stage all changes in the current directory

### `git commit`
Create a save point with a descriptive message about what you changed.
- Type `git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"`
- Write clear messages like "Add styling to header" or "Fix navigation bug"

### `git push`
Upload your committed changes to GitHub so they're backed up and visible to others.
- Type `git push` to send your commits to the remote repository

### When to Use Each
1. Make changes to your code files
2. Run `git add .` to stage your changes
3. Run `git commit -m "description"` to create a save point with a message
4. Run `git push` to upload your changes to GitHub

Repeat this cycle regularly—don't wait until you've made a huge number of changes before committing!
